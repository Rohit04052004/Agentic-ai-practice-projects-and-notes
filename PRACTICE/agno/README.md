# Agno Agent

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the `agno` library to create a question-answering agent. The agent uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to respond to user queries.

## Files

- `L1_agno.py`: This script initializes an `agno` agent, sets up the OpenAI API key from a `.env` file, and asks the agent a question. The response is then streamed to the console.
