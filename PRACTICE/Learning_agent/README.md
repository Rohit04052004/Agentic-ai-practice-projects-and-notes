# Q-learning Snake Agent

This project is a simple implementation of a snake game where the snake learns to find food using Q-learning.

## Description

The `demo.py` file contains the entire implementation. It uses `pygame` for the game interface and `numpy` for the Q-table. The snake learns to navigate the grid to eat food and avoid collisions with itself or the walls.
