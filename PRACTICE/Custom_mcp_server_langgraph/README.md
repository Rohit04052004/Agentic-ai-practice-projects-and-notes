# Custom MCP Server with LangGraph

This project demonstrates how to create a custom MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) server and integrate it with a LangGraph-based agent.

## Components

*   `custom_mcp_server.py`: A simple MCP server with tools for basic math operations.
*   `mcp_client_langgraph.py`: A client that connects to the MCP server and uses a LangGraph agent to perform calculations.
*   `web_app.py`: A Streamlit web application that provides a user interface for interacting with the math agent.
