# Agentic AI Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of practice projects focused on building and understanding various types of AI agents. Each project is self-contained in its own directory and includes a dedicated README with specific details.

A `.gitignore` file is included to exclude common unwanted files such as environment variables (`.env`), Jupyter Notebook checkpoints, Python bytecode, and IDE-specific folders.

## Handwritten Notes

This directory contains handwritten notes on various Agentic AI topics, including:
- Agentic Frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAi, Agno)
- MCP Server (Intro, Setup, Custom, Cloud)
- Types of Agents and Reinforcement Learning
- OpenAI Agents SDK
