# Agentic AI Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of practice projects focused on building and understanding various types of AI agents. Each project is self-contained in its own directory and includes a dedicated README with specific details.

A `.gitignore` file is included to exclude common unwanted files such as environment variables (`.env`), Jupyter Notebook checkpoints, Python bytecode, and IDE-specific folders.

## Projects

- **Agno Agents Tools Memory (`/Agno_agents_tools_memory`)**: Explores the `agno` library to create agents that can use tools and maintain memory. The Jupyter notebook in this directory demonstrates how to build an agent that can summarize text and search for information.

- **Custom MCP Server with LangGraph (`/Custom_mcp_server_langgraph`)**: Implements a custom MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) server with mathematical tools. The project uses `langgraph` to create a client that can interact with the server and perform calculations.

- **Learning Agent (`/Learning_agent`)**: A Q-learning agent that learns to play the game of Snake. This project uses `pygame` for the game environment and `numpy` for the Q-table.

- **MCP Server on Cloud (`/MCP_server_on_cloud`)**: Demonstrates how to set up a simple MCP server on the cloud. The project includes a server with basic math tools and a client that can interact with it.

- **MCP Server Tutorial (`/MCP_server_tutorial`)**: A tutorial on how to set up and use an MCP server. The project includes a server with a calculator and a client that can interact with it.

- **MCP with Agno (`/Mcp_with_agno`)**: Integrates MCP servers with the `agno` library. The project demonstrates how to create an `agno` agent that can use tools from an MCP server.

- **Agno (`/agno`)**: A simple demonstration of the `agno` library to create a question-answering agent.

- **Simple Reflex Agent (`/demo_simple_reflex_agent.py`)**: A basic implementation of a simple reflex agent in a 2x2 grid environment. The agent's goal is to clean any dirty room it encounters.

- **Handwritten Notes (`/HANDWRITTEN NOTES`)**: A collection of handwritten notes on various Agentic AI topics, including frameworks, MCP servers, and reinforcement learning.
